# How to play Fungus Wars

Players take turns placing pieces with the goal of capturing the opponent's pieces and eventually home square.
Each new piece that is placed must be adjacent to that player's existing pieces and cannot overlap any occupied spaces.

## Capturing

If there is an uninterrupted vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line of an opponents pieces between two of your pieces,
those pieces get captured and become your own.
A capture can trigger additional captures. If pieces remain that have no path back to a home square, they wither and die.

## Bites

Instead of placing a piece, a player may elect to use one of a limited number of "bites" to clear out an adjacent square or squares.
Extra bites can be obtained by placing a piece on a square with a "▴" marker.
Players also get additional bites by gaining ownership of a certain threshold of cells.

## Rerolls

Placing a piece on a square with a die grants a reroll. Using a reroll selects another piece to use for that turn.
